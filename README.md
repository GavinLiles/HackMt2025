## Play the game:
- Github Pages: https://GavinLiles.github.io/HackMt2025/

## Dev env Setup
1. Download [Godot 4.3](https://godotengine.org/)
	- Either add the .exe to your PATH as `godot` or refer to it by path for the next command.
1. Open a terminal in project root directory and install addons via gd-plug:
	- Windows: `godot -headless -s plug.gd install`
	- Mac: `Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot  -headless -s plug.gd install`
1. Delete the `.plugged` folder in the root dir since we can't prevent linting on it
